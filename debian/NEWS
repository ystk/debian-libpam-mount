libpam-mount (1.27-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The file inclusion of /etc/pam.d/common-pammount is now deprecated.
    It has been replaced with pam-auth-update(8). Read the
    pam-auth-update(8) manpage for more information.
    .
    As a result, all manually added inclusions of common-pammount of
    files in /etc/pam.d should be removed or commented out.
    A note will be printed on the console if such inclusions are
    detected on upgrade.

libpam-mount (0.21-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * When upgrading from versions << 0.20 the old configuration will
    automatically be converted to the new format and stored at
    /etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml.
    The default configuration will be available at
    /etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml.default.
    .
    Note that per-user configuration files ($HOME/.pam_mount.conf)
    have still to be converted manually.
    .
    IMPORTANT: please check the validity of the converted file
    /etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml, since the converter might
    have introduced bugs.

libpam-mount (0.20-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The pam_mount.conf syntax changed in version 0.20.0. It is now
    in an XML format and stored in /etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml.
    .
    You can convert your old pam_mount.conf file to the new XML syntax
    with the script
    /usr/share/doc/libpam-mount/examples/convert_pam_mount_conf.pl.
    .
    Note that this script needs the libxml-writer-perl package installed.

libpam-mount (0.10.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The pam_mount.conf syntax changed in version 0.10.0.
    Old 'local' filesystem types are now invalid. Replace them with
    the actual filesystem type of the partition you are mounting.
    For example a line:
      volume user local - /home/user.img /home/user loop,user,exec,encryption=aes,keybits=256 - -
    now must be:
      volume user ext3 - /home/user.img /home/user loop,user,exec,encryption=aes,keybits=256 - -
  * Furthermore, the old "smb" filesystem type must be renamed to "smbfs".
