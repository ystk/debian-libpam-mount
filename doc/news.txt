====


v2.14 (2013-08-27)
==================
Enhancements:
- pam_mount: add an "allow_discard" option for volumes to enable
  trim support on the block device without enabling it for the filesystem.
- config: regexes can now be used for the <user> and <group> configuration
  options
Fixes:
- fix "feature 1 already set to zero"
- pmt-ehd: avoid miscalculating blockdev size obtained from BLKGETSIZE64
- pam_mount: give more verbose output on "unknown digest/cipher"
- pam_mount: fix crash when an unknown digest/cipher was specified
- pam_mount: correctly mkdir mountpoint if requested
- pam_mount: only remove mountpoint if actually created
- config: restore DOMAIN_USER and DOMAIN_NAME expansion in mount options
Changes:
- Complain louder when EUID is not 0
- Make CIFS mounts work again after util-linux option parser update.
  util-linux has received updates to its option parser in or around
  v2.22, and pam_mount was incorrectly using the "user" moutn option
  to specify a username; the proper option is, of course, "username".
  (as in: <volume fstype="cifs" ... options="username=someoneelse" />)
- Make Winbind user logins (DOMAIN\user) work with cifs-utils > 5.5


v2.13 (2011-12-15)
==================
Fixes:
- pam_mount: restore keyfile support for non-crypto mounts
  (useful for accessing volumes with a different password than the login one)
Changes:
- pam_mount: use libmount for utab/mtab operations
- Move crypto code into a separate library, libcryptmount
  rather than including the .o files in every executable
Enhancements:
- mount.crypt: add support for crypto name mapping (new -o crypto_name= option)


v2.12 (2011-10-06)
==================
Fixes:
- build: make build of pmt-ehd dependent upon HAVE_LIBCRYPTSETUP
- mount.crypt: restore support for files >= 4 GB
Changes:
- config: default to calling umount.crypt directly

  (there are setups where that has no effect anyway)
- mount.crypt: do not call lower-level helpers with -i option
- mount.crypt: use /run directory to store cmtab
- pmvarrun: use /run/pam_mount directory

Changes:
- conf: %(shell EXPR) is now activated and usable from the global config file


v2.6 (2010-10-30)
=================
Fixes:
- pam_mount: up the refcount once freeconfig is live
Changes:
- remove shipped copy of ofl, use hxtools's original variant
- remove shipped copy of fd0ssh, use hxtools's original variant


v2.5 (2010-08-10)
=================
Changes:
- mount.crypt: fix incorrect processing of binary files in keyfile passthrough
- call mount.crypt by means of mount -t crypt (selinux), same for umount
- reorder the default path to search in /usr/local first, then /usr, /
- config: add missing fd0ssh command to restore volumes using ssh
- ofl is now run as a separate process (selinux policy simplification)


v2.4 (2010-06-26)
=================
Notes:
- see doc/bugs.txt for cryptsetup behavior that impacts
  pam_mount users since version 2.0
- recommending use of device-mapper >= 1.02.48 to avoid a race
Fixes:
- umount.crypt: fix use of a wrong field for smtab/cmtab staleness check
Changes:

v2.3 (2010-05-19)
=================
Fixes:
- umount.crypt had erroneously mounted instead of umounted


v2.2 (2010-05-16)
=================
Fixes:
- mount.crypt: fix memory scribble crash when crypto device could
  not be initialized
- mount.crypt: do not fail when unlocking key slot other than #0
- fusermount is now called with supplementary groups initialized
- rdconf: do not warn about missing fskeyhash when no fskey specified

=================
Fixes:
- config: rdconf1 static data had unclosed %(if) tags

v2.0 (2010-04-20)
=================
Changes:
- mount.crypt: make use of libcryptsetup
- cmtab is now stored below localstatedir (usually /var/run)
- use HXformat2. This invalidates old constructs like %(before=\"-o\"...),
  which need to be replaced with the new syntax. (See below.)

In general, the old syntax was only used by commands Note to updaters: As the
old syntax %(after=...) %(before=...) %(ifempty=...) %(ifnempty=...)
%(lower=...) %(upper=...) only appeared in commands, and commands are not part
of the default config file anymore since v1.0~15^2~15, there should be little
worry. The configuration options in question are <cifsmount>, <cryptmount>,
<cryptumount>, <fd0ssh>, <fsck>, <fusemount>, <fuseumount>, <lclmount>,
<nfsmount>, <ncpmount>, <ncpumount>, <pmvarrun>, <smbmount>, <smbumount>
<umount> and should normally not be needed in pam_mount.conf.xml.

v0.21 (2007-09-17)
==================
Some mount helpers needed a different option passing method.
Stacking of loop devices is now avoided, and pam_mount will not ask
for a password if no volumes are to be mounted. The documentation has
been updated to include PAM module stacking (e.g. when using pam_ldap
with pam_mount).

- silence unwanted error message (fallout from r240)
- add "Known Bugs and Issues" documentation
- more documentation - How to stack PAM modules without pam_stack
- option passing to some mount helpers needs to be different
- avoid stacking of loop devices
- do not ask for password if no volumes found

==================
This release adds extra options regarding pam_mount behavior
(messages and mount points).

- do not use absolute paths, search $PATH instead for programs
- add pam_mount.conf to .conf.xml converter
- "sufficient" keyword documentation
- misc cryptmount fix
- pass down readonly flag to luksOpen
- add option to retain automatically created mountpoints

- allow changing the password prompt
- add an overview of pam_mount options (options.txt)
- implement the "soft_try_pass" option


v0.19 (2007-07-04)

variables and options. Support for truecrypt was added.

- pam_mount switched to an XML configuration.
- NT domain placeholders
- properly detect loop64 support
- split group matching into multiple attributes
- add an "invert" attribute

directory before attempting to (un)mount.

- change to / before attempting mount
- check return value in xmemdup()
- fix segfault on x64: Do not reuse va_lists (found by Celestar)


v0.17 (2006-08-06)

environment variables for FUSE daemons are now set, and configure has
two new options (--slibdir and --sbindir).

- set important environment variables for fuse daemons
- added new --slibdir and --ssbindir options to configure
- documentation updates


v0.15 (2006-07-26)
==================
- mount.crypt and umount.crypt are installed to /sbin rather
  than /usr/sbin; /bin/mount only looks into /sbin
- KRB5 credentials are now set in the environment
- fix XDM crash, for GCC >= 4.x
- disable debug output by default (confused gksu) [sf bug #1524325]
- do FUSE mounts done unprivileged [sf bug #1489657 and ML]
- fixed: /bin/login sends SIGHUP/SIGTERM to outstanding session
  processes after PAM completed; this killed fuse daemons
- work around XDM crash (symbol clash), for GCC <= 3.x;
  the proper solution would be that XDM be NOT compiled with -rdynamic
- properly truncate /var/run/pam_mount/YOURNAME files [sf bug #1503246]

v0.12.2 (2006-01-31)
====================
Mount smbfs and cifs mounts with ownership belonging to the user
rather than root.


v0.12.0 (2006-01-11)
====================
This version fixes an fd leak, expansion problems with @group and a
wrong inversion. The smb/ncp filesystem types have been superseded by
smbfs/ncpfs. Support for secondary "@@groups" was added.


v0.11 (2005-12-28)
==================
- fix some memory leaks, unterminated strings, extra trailing
  slashes, double frees
- fixed: wildcards were not expanded for "@group"s
- account for trailing slashes and path resolution in umount.crypt


v0.10 (2005-11-18)
==================
- support ANY [kernel] filesystem (yes, finally) -- includes tmpfs,
  fuse mounts and --bind operations.
- merged various patches and fixes by Bastian Kleineidam
- handle symlinks better (read: resolve them, so that the result
  matches /bin/mount's resolving behavior)
- implemented group volumes, to be used by "volume @xyz ..."
- cleaned the code up here and there
