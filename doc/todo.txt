o unit tests

o passwdehd needs work.

o make a test system that takes XML and creates  pam_mount.conf, images,
efsk's, mnt points and check script.

o how can I determine target user name when root su's to another user
or when I ssh using public key?

o need progress feedback from fsck, especially for gdm.

o regression tests:
	options = '-', do not use fstab
	options = '-', use fstab (mnt pt not defined either)

o Should -N go in pam_mount.conf like it is now?  Shall I put this in
conf/pam_mount.conf?  How does hashing/not hashing effect scripts?

o Get rid of FIXMEs.

= OpenBSD =====================================================================

o Add losetup/fsck code.

o Add support to vnconfig for reading passwords from stdin so that
it can be used for EHD on OBSD.

o Can't tell if EHD is already mounted on OpenBSD because mount says:
/dev/svnd0c on /home/mike/enc..., not /home/mike.img on /home/mike/enc.

o Make EHD on OpenBSD and Linux as similar as possible document EHD
on OpenBSD.

o Test new openpam to ensure OpenBSD patches are integrated.
