Q.  I want to ask for help.  What information should I provide?

A.  You need to provide us the following:

    * A full log of a failed session with debugging turned on in
      pam_mount.conf.xml
    * The version of pam_mount that you are using
    * /etc/pam.d/* as relevant
    * pam_mount.conf.xml as relevant, preferably completely

=======================================================================

Q.  Is there a pam_mount mailing list?

A.  Yes, http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=41452

=======================================================================

Q.  What does the following error mean: pam_mount: error trying to
    retrieve authtok from session code?

A.  This often means that the pam_mount module was not executed as an
    auth type module. This error is usually due to a misconfigured auth
    PAM stack (/etc/pam.d/<service>). For example, if you use an auth
    PAM module configured with the control flag of sufficient, then
    pam_mount needs to be executed before it.

=======================================================================

Q.  What does the following error mean: Error reading password from file
    descriptor 0: empty password?"

A.  This often means that pam_mount was not run as an auth type module,
    so it did not receive a password (file descriptor 0 is stdin and
    that is how pam_mount transmits passwords to mount). A module
    above pam_mount in the PAM configuration stack that is configured
    as sufficient can cause this. As the README file states, do this:

        auth    required    pam_mount.so
        auth    sufficient  pam_ldap.so use_first_pass

    NOT THIS:

        auth sufficient pam_ldap.so
        auth required   pam_mount.so

=======================================================================

Q.  Why am I prompted for a password twice after installing pam_mount?

A.  Like most PAM modules, pam_mount prompts the user for a password.
    When used with another auth type module, such as pam_unix2, this
    may result in both modules prompting for a password. In order to
    get a more desirable behavior, instruct the second module to use
    the first password entered by using the use_first_pass option.
    The exact option name for other modules may be different from
    "use_first_pass", so be sure to check their documentation.

Q.  Why am I having trouble logging in with KDE while using an SMB
    share as my home directory?

A.  SMB (and some other non-UNIX-native network filesystems) do not
    support special file types needed by KDE. Either mount your SMB
    share as a subdirectory of your home directory or instruct KDE to
    use /tmp for its special files.

=======================================================================

Q.  Why are my volumes not being unmounted when I log out?

A.  Often this is because processes remaining after logging out are
    holding open files in your home directory. For example, some versions
    of gconf do this. The best way to figure out what programs are guilty
    is to enable debugging in your pam_mount.conf.xml, and watch for
    ofl's output in your logs.

Q.  Why are my smbmounts hanging when using Red Hat Linux 9?

A.  See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=103200.

    Try creating /sbin/mount.smbfs_no_nptl with this content:

        #!/bin/sh
        export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1
        exec smbmount "$@"

    Then configure pam_mount with the following in pam_mount.conf.xml:

        <smbmount>/bin/mount -t smbfs_no_nptl</smbmount>

=======================================================================

Q.  Will pam_mount work with my ftpd?

A.  I do not know. I know that vsftpd works fine with pam_mount. You
    need to specify "session_support=YES" in your vsftpd.conf. You also
    need to be careful about pam_mount sending debugging information
    down the FTP connection.

=======================================================================

Q.  Why does pam_mount not work right with OpenSSH?

A.  As of version 3.3, sshd has a feature called privilege separation
    that is incompatible with PAM modules needing root privileges. In
    addition, OpenSSH does not use PAM by default. OpenSSH before 4.9
    does not properly deal with PAM. See bugs.txt.

    [...]

    Finally, Darren Tucker has explained:

        OK, here is what is happening: sshd forks when doing
        challenge-response authentication, and the pam_authenticate
        call happens in the child (the authentication "thread",
        although it is normally a process).

        This, BTW, is because pam_authenticate blocks while waiting for
        responses from the conversation function. In sshd this blocking
        means that the dispatch loop (which is needed to communicate
        with the user) is not running until pam_authenticate completes,
        but it cannot complete until because the dispatch loop is not
        running. Another process is used to prevent this deadlock.

        It would appear that pam_mount relies on either module-private
        data set during the pam_authenticate or the PAM_AUTHTOK item,
        both of which are lost when the the authentication "thread"
        exits. pam_mount goes looking for them during session
        initialization in order to authenticate to the SMB server,
        cannot get them and fails.

        Since you have OpenSSH 3.9p1, you can set
        "ChallengeResponseAuthentication no" and
        "PasswordAuthentication yes" in sshd_config and it ought to
        work (with or without privsep).

        If you absolutely *must* have challenge-response authentication
        then you can build OpenSSH with the pthread hack, but this it
        not recommended.

        If you have trouble with it not dismounting then you will need
        to apply the patch in this bug (this one only works with
        privsep=no, and I cannot see a good way to fix this for the
        general case): http://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=926

=======================================================================

Q.  Why are my volumes not being unmounted by pam_mount?

A.  Some stupid programs keep files open that make it impossible to
    umount. There is a <logout> directive in the configuration file
    to kill programs when needed.

=======================================================================

Q.  What is with the auth requirement for pam_mount?  Should not this be
    a session module only?

A.  PAM discards the password after all modules from the "auth" stage
    have run, giving no possibility to retrieve it for "session" stage
    modules. In case pam_mount does not have the password by the time
    the session stage is executed, it will try to prompt for it.

=======================================================================

Q.  I want to use a FUSE share as my home directory but GNOME/KDE do
    not seem to like this (error messages, lockups). Why?

A.  Big desktop environments as the aforementioned make use of locking,
    symbolic links, and potentially local sockets (UNIX sockets).
    If the filesystem and/or the remote server do not support these,
    error messages or lockups may ensue.

=======================================================================

Q.  I want to use an NCP share as my home directory but X does not seem
    to like this. Why?

A.  The X authentication utility xauth uses file system facilities not
    supported by the Linux ncpfs driver. In order to work around this,
    try adding something like the following to your shell's
    configuration file:

        export XAUTHORITY=/tmp/.Xauthority
        export ICEAUTHORITY=/tmp/.ICEauthority

    If you use gdm then you may want to modify gdm.conf's UserAuthDir
    instead of setting XAUTHORITY.

    If you also wish to allow OpenSSH to tunnel X out of the same
    computer, then ensure /etc/ssh/sshd_config is configured with
    PermitUserEnvironment enabled and add the following to
    ~/.ssh/environment:

        XAUTHORITY=/tmp/.Xauthority

=======================================================================

Q.  Can I use pam_mount on an SELinux-enabled system?

A.  I would not recommend it right now on a production system. However,
    until pam_mount nicely integrates, you can take a look at the
    included pam_mount_macros.te.

    Any filesystem that is mounted on $HOME must have the context of
    its root directory set to user_home_dir_t.

    Encrypted filesystems keys should generally have the context of
    user_home_t.

    If you wish to mount user-owned loopback filesystem images then
    these images must have their file context set to user_home_t.

    Because it changes the context of child processes of things like
    login and su, pam_selinux must be invoked after pam_mount on login.
    Because this effect on contexts must be reversed before pam_mount,
    pam_selinux must be invoked before pam_mount on logout:

        session required /lib/security/$ISA/pam_selinux.so close
        session required /lib/security/$ISA/pam_mount.so
        session required /lib/security/$ISA/pam_selinux.so open multiple
