State of ports.


Solaris:
- nothing done so far.
- PAM component seemed to compile last time, otherwise untested.


FreeBSD:
- loop is working,
- crypto: GELI and GBDE both have (IMO) wacky key setup scheme - the
  frontend programs at least always want passphrases, but mount.crypt
  is going to deliver the key for the cipher engine already.
  Hence no crypto-geli.c/crypto-gbde.c as of this writing.
- mount.crypt probably does not call mount(8) right yet.
- pmt-ehd does not know newfs(8).
- PAM component compiles, but is untested.


NetBSD:
- loop is working
- cgd crypto device setup is working
  but does not produce anything usable - only first 131072 bytes
  are readable - what gives
- newfs -I /dev/rcgd0d failed. Disklabel crap? I want to use bare devices.
- mount.crypt probably does not call mount(8) right yet.
- pmt-ehd does not know newfs(8).
- PAM component compiles, but is untested.


OpenBSD:
- Does not have PAM.
