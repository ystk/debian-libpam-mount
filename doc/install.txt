Minimum required packages for building pam_mount from a tarball release:

	* libHX 3.12.1 or up
	* libmount 2.20 or up
	* libpcre 7.0 or up
	* libxml 2.6.x or up
	* pkg-config 0.19 or up
	* Linux-PAM 0.99.x or up
	SUN-PAM (compiled-tested only with 5.11-Beta Build 85)
	BSD PAM is untested and probably not working right now.

Additional required packages for building from (Git) snapshot:

	* autoconf 2.59 or up
	* automake 1.10 or up
	* libtool 1.5.22 or up (older ones might work)

Then, optional packages for building:

	* openssl 0.9.8 or up
	* libcryptsetup 1.1.2 or up -- block-level encryption

Suggested packages for runtime:

	* hxtools
		- fd0ssh: to support passing passwords to SSH
		- ofl: to support kill-on-logout

	local targets:
	* encfs 1.4 or up -- file-level encryption

	remote targets:
	* sshfs -- SFTP-over-SSH
	* ccgfs -- ccgfs-over-SSH (full operation support; mknod, acl, xattrs)
	* cifs-mount -- for CIFS and SMB shares

	configuration validation:
	* xmllint (libxml2)

Notes for configure:

OpenSSL and/or libcryptsetup are optional, to build without them however
you need to explicitly specify --without-crypto and/or
--without-libcryptsetup, respectively.

DTD installation usage:

	Configure pam_mount with:
		--with-dtd

	To validate (assuming the installation prefix was /usr):
		xmllint --nonet --noout --loaddtd --valid
		--path /usr/share/xml/pam_mount/dtd/pam_mount.conf.xml.dtd
		/etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml
